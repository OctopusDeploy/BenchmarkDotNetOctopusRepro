# BenchmarkDotNetOctopusRepro
A minimal Demo repo to reproduce a BenchmarkDotNet bug


## Background

Octopus Deploy uses a custom solution struture to facilitate a versioning strategy that is applied across all projects within the solution. To achieve this, a custom `Solution Items`directory is created which contains data that is applied to each project (e.g. `Solution Items\solutionInfo.cs`). Each project automically links to these solution files via the `Directory.Build.props` file, which specifies the link behavior:

```
<Project>
    <ItemGroup>
        <Compile Include="..\Solution Items\SolutionInfo.cs">
            <Link>Properties\SolutionInfo.cs</Link>
        </Compile>
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
````

This setup is currently incompatible with the way BenchmarkDotNet compiles its jobs.

## Error details

```
CSC : error CS2001: Source file 'C:\BenchmarkDotNetOctopusRepro\source\Demo.Project\bin\netcoreapp3.1\Job-CDMLNR\..\Solution Items\VersionInfo.cs' could not be found. [C:\BenchmarkDotNetOctopusRepro\source\Demo.Project\bin\netcoreapp3.1\Job-CDMLNR\BenchmarkDotNet.Autogenerated.csproj]
```

It seems that the files specified by the `Directory.Build.props` links is not able to be read by BenchmarkDotNet when using the solution struture provided in this repo.
